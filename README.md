Here’s a detailed review of psutil.ps1, mapping what’s implemented and what’s missing, based on your app structure and the script’s content:

What’s Implemented

- Core Config: $Global:Config is well-defined, covering settings, UI, messages, colors, patterns, and more.
- Main App Class: PSUtilApp is implemented, with state for Config, Controls, Machines, Sources, Users, Plugins, Theme, I18N, State, and static SourceRegistry.
- Source System: Abstract class PSUtilTaskSource and concrete sources (AllTasksSource, FavouriteSource, LocalScriptFileSource) are present.
- Task Object: PSUtilTask class with Description, Command, File, LineNumber.
- Source Discovery: RegisterSourceType and LoadSources methods for dynamic source loading.
- Directory/User/Machine Init: InitDirectories, InitUsers, InitMachines methods.
- UI Construction: InitControls builds a WinForms UI with panels, buttons, list views, and event handlers.
- Task Parsing: ParseScriptFile method to extract tasks from script files.
- Task Execution: OnExecute method for running selected tasks, with status/progress updates.
- Secondary Panels: ShowCopyCommandPanel, ShowRunLaterPanel, ShowAddCommandPanel for extra task actions.
- Sidebar/Toolbar: Controls for source/machine/user selection, filtering, and batch actions.
- Event Handlers: For all major UI actions (execute, select all, switch source, etc.).
- Basic Plugin Hooks: Plugins hash table and SourceRegistry for extensibility.

What’s Missing or Incomplete

- Save/Load Settings: No SaveSettings or LoadSettings methods for persisting/restoring app state and user preferences.
- ApplyTheme/SetLanguage: No methods for applying themes or switching languages at runtime.
- Plugin Loading: No dynamic loading/discovery of external plugin scripts or DLLs.
- Remote/Network Sources: No implementation for remote/network sources (e.g., SSH, GitHub, etc.) beyond placeholders.
- Task Scheduling: ShowRunLaterPanel UI exists, but actual scheduling logic is not implemented.
- Add Command Logic: ShowAddCommandPanel UI exists, but logic to add/save new commands as tasks is not implemented.
- User/Machine Management: Only minimal user/machine lists; no add/edit/remove or advanced management.
- State Persistence: No code for saving/restoring window size, last source, or other runtime state.
- Error Handling: Some try/catch, but not comprehensive error/logging throughout.
- i18n/Theme Extensibility: No code for loading/applying external i18n or theme resources (for plugins or user customization).
- Plugin UI: No mechanism for plugins to add custom UI controls or features.
- Documentation/Help: No in-app help/about or user documentation integration.
- Testing: No test harness or test mode for safe experimentation.
- Advanced Features: No notifications, automation, or advanced scheduling.

Let me know if you want a prioritized action plan or details on how to implement any missing features!


Here’s a prioritized action plan to address the missing features in psutil.ps1, with a focus on robust, maintainable, and error-free implementation. I will proceed step by step, checking for stray code and syntax issues after each change.

Top Priorities (Core Functionality & User Experience)

1. Save/Load Settings & State
- Implement SaveSettings and LoadSettings methods in PSUtilApp.
- Persist user preferences, window size, last source, and other runtime state to a file (e.g., db.json).
- Load these settings on startup and apply them.

2. ApplyTheme & SetLanguage
- Implement ApplyTheme and SetLanguage methods.
- Allow runtime switching of themes and languages using the config and i18n dictionaries.
- Update UI controls dynamically when these are changed.

3. Task Scheduling Logic
- Implement backend logic for scheduling tasks (ShowRunLaterPanel).
- Use Windows Task Scheduler or a simple background timer to run tasks at a later time.

4. Add Command Logic
- Implement logic to add/save new commands as tasks from ShowAddCommandPanel.
- Persist new tasks to a file or in-memory list.

5. Plugin Loading & Extensibility
- Implement dynamic loading/discovery of external plugin scripts (e.g., from a Plugins directory).
- Allow plugins to register new Source types and add UI controls.

6. Remote/Network Sources
- Implement at least one remote/network source (e.g., SSH or GitHub).
- Fetch tasks/scripts from remote locations and display them in the UI.

7. User/Machine Management
- Add UI and logic for adding, editing, and removing users/machines.
- Persist these lists.

8. Error Handling & Logging
- Add comprehensive try/catch blocks and logging throughout the app.
- Display user-friendly error messages.

9. i18n/Theme Extensibility
- Allow loading/applying external i18n and theme resources (e.g., from JSON files or plugins).

10. Plugin UI Extension
- Allow plugins to add custom UI controls or features to the main form.

11. Documentation/Help
- Add an in-app help/about section and link to user documentation.

12. Testing
- Add a test harness or test mode for safe experimentation.

Next Steps

I will begin by implementing SaveSettings and LoadSettings in PSUtilApp, ensuring settings and state are persisted and restored. After that, I will proceed to ApplyTheme and SetLanguage, and so on, checking for syntax and stray code issues after each change.

Would you like me to start with Save/Load Settings, or do you want to prioritize a different feature first?

The extraneous or misplaced closing brace at the end of psutil.ps1 has been removed, ensuring proper script and class closure. The file structure is now correct.

Next steps should focus on:
- Adding error handling/logging to any remaining event handlers or methods.
- Implementing dynamic plugin loading/discovery.
- Enhancing i18n/theme extensibility.
- Improving user/machine management.
- Adding in-app documentation/help.
- Creating a test harness or test mode.
